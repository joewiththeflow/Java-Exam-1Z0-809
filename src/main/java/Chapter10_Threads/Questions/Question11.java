// If the code compiles, which of the following pairs of method invocations could NEVER be executing at the same time?
// (Choose all tha pply)

// A. x.a() in thread1, and x.a() in thread2
// B. x.a() in thread1, and x.b() in thread2
// C. x.a() in thread1, and y.a() in thread2
// D. x.a() in thread1, and y.b() in thread2
// E. x.b() in thread1, and x.a() in thread2
// F. x.b() in thread1, and x.b() in thread2
// G. x.b() in thread1, and y.a() in thread2
// H. x.b() in thread1, and y.b() in thread2
// I. Compilation fails due to an error in Runnable






//A, F, and H are correct. A is correct because when synchronized instance methods are called on the same instance,
// they block each other. F and H canâ€™t happen because synchronized static methods in the same class block each other,
// regardless of which instance was used to call the methods. (An instance is not required to call static methods;
// only the class.)

// C, although incorrect, could happen because synchronized instance methods called on different instances do not block
// each other. B, D, E, and G are incorrect but also could all happen because instance methods and static methods lock
// on different objects and do not block each other. I is incorrect because the code compiles.
