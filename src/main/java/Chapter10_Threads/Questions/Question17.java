// Given these two fragments:

// I. synchronized void move(long id)
// II. void move(long id)

// When ether fragment is inserted at line 9, which are true? (Choose all that apply)

// A. Compilation fails
// B. With fragment I, an exception is thrown
// C. With fragment I, the output could be 4 2 4 2  --> CORRECT
// D. With fragment I, the output could be 4 4 2 3
// E. With fragment II, the output could be 2 4 2 4 --> CORRECT



// C and E are correct. E should be obvious. C is correct because, even though move() is synchronized, itâ€™s being
// invoked on two different objects.
//
// A, B, and D are incorrect based on the above. (OCP Objective 10.3)
